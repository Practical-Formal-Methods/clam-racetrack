' This example reads a MIP model from a file, adds artificial
' variables to each constraint, and then minimizes the sum of the
' artificial variables.  A solution with objective zero corresponds
' to a feasible solution to the input model.
' We can also use FeasRelax feature to do it. In this example, we
' use minrelax=1, i.e. optimizing the returned model finds a solution
' that minimizes the original objective, but only from among those
' solutions that minimize the sum of the artificial variables.
