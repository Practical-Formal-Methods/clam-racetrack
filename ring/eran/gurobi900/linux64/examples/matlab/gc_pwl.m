% This example formulates and solves the following simple model
% with PWL constraints:
%
%  maximize
%        sum c(j) * x(j)
%  subject to
%        sum A(i,j) * x(j) <= 0,  for i = 1, ..., m
%        sum y(j) <= 3
%        y(j) = pwl(x(j)),        for j = 1, ..., n
%        x(j) free, y(j) >= 0,    for j = 1, ..., n
%
%  where pwl(x) = 0,     if x  = 0
%               = 1+|x|, if x != 0
%
%  Note
%   1. sum pwl(x(j)) <= b is to bound x vector and also to favor sparse x vector.
%      Here b = 3 means that at most two x(j) can be nonzero and if two, then
%      sum x(j) <= 1
%   2. pwl(x) jumps from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1, if x moves from negative 0 to 0,
%      then to positive 0, so we need three points at x = 0. x has infinite bounds
%      on both sides, the piece defined with two points (-1, 2) and (0, 1) can
%      extend x to -infinite. Overall we can use five points (-1, 2), (0, 1),
%      (0, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 2) to define y = pwl(x)
