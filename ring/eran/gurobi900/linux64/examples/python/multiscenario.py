# Facility location: a company currently ships its product from 5 plants to
# 4 warehouses. It is considering closing some plants to reduce costs. What
# plant(s) should the company close, in order to minimize transportation
# and fixed costs?
#
# Since the plant fixed costs and the warehouse demands are uncertain, a
# scenario approach is chosen.
#
# Note that this example is similar to the facility.py example. Here we
# added scenarios in order to illustrate the multi-scenario feature.
#
# Note that this example uses lists instead of dictionaries.  Since
# it does not work with sparse data, lists are a reasonable option.
