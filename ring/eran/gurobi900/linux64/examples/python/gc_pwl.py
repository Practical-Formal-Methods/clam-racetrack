# This example formulates and solves the following simple model
# with PWL constraints:
#
#  maximize
#        sum c[j] * x[j]
#  subject to
#        sum A[i,j] * x[j] <= 0,  for i = 0, ..., m-1
#        sum y[j] <= 3
#        y[j] = pwl(x[j]),        for j = 0, ..., n-1
#        x[j] free, y[j] >= 0,    for j = 0, ..., n-1
#  where pwl(x) = 0,     if x  = 0
#               = 1+|x|, if x != 0
#
#  Note
#   1. sum pwl(x[j]) <= b is to bound x vector and also to favor sparse x vector.
#      Here b = 3 means that at most two x[j] can be nonzero and if two, then
#      sum x[j] <= 1
#   2. pwl(x) jumps from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1, if x moves from negative 0 to 0,
#      then to positive 0, so we need three points at x = 0. x has infinite bounds
#      on both sides, the piece defined with two points (-1, 2) and (0, 1) can
#      extend x to -infinite. Overall we can use five points (-1, 2), (0, 1),
#      (0, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 2) to define y = pwl(x)
