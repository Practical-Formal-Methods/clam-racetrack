.NET API Overview
</H1>

<P>
This section documents the Gurobi .NET interface.  This manual begins
with a quick overview of the classes exposed in the interface and the
most important methods on those classes.  It then continues with a
<A HREF="cs_net_api_details.html#sec:.NET-details">comprehensive presentation of all of the available classes and
methods</A>.

<P>
If you are new to the Gurobi Optimizer, we suggest that you start with
the
<A ID="tex2html15"
  HREF="../quickstart_windows/index.html">Quick Start Guide</A>
or the
<A ID="tex2html16"
  HREF="../examples/examples.html">Example Tour</A>.
These
documents provide concrete examples of how to use the classes and
methods described here.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Environments</SPAN>

<P>
The first step in using the Gurobi .NET interface is to create an
environment object.  Environments are represented using the
<A HREF="cs_grbenv.html#dotnetclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> class.  An environment acts as
the container for all data associated with a set of optimization runs.
You will generally only need one environment object in your program.

<P>
For more advanced use cases, you can use an empty environment to create
an uninitialized environment and then, programmatically, set all
required options for your specific requirements. For further details
see the <A HREF="empty_environments.html#sec:EmptyEnvironment">Empty Environment</A>
section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Models</SPAN>

<P>
You can create one or more optimization models within an environment.
Each model is represented as an object of class
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel.html#dotnetclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A>.  A model consists
of a set of decision variables (objects of class
<A HREF="cs_grbvar.html#dotnetclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A>),
a linear or quadratic objective function on those variables (specified
using
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_setobjective.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.SetObjective">GRBModel.SetObjective</A>),
and a set of constraints on these variables (objects of class
<A HREF="cs_grbconstr.html#dotnetclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbqconstr.html#dotnetclass:GRBQConstr">GRBQConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbsos.html#dotnetclass:GRBSOS">GRBSOS</A>,
or <A HREF="cs_grbgenconstr.html#dotnetclass:GRBGenConstr">GRBGenConstr</A>).
Each variable has an associated lower bound, upper bound,
and type (continuous, binary, etc.).  Each linear or
quadratic
constraint has an associated sense (less-than-or-equal,
greater-than-or-equal, or equal), and right-hand side value.
Refer to
<A HREF="variables_and_constraints_.html#sec:VarsConstraintsObjectives">this section</A>
for more information on variables, constraints, and objectives.

<P>
Linear constraints are specified by building linear expressions
(objects of class <A HREF="cs_grblinexpr.html#dotnetclass:GRBLinExpr">GRBLinExpr</A>),
and then specifying relationships between these expressions (for
example, requiring that one expression be equal to another).
Quadratic constraints are built in a similar fashion, but using
quadratic expressions (objects of class
<A HREF="cs_grbquadexpr.html#dotnetclass:GRBQuadExpr">GRBQuadExpr</A>) instead.

<P>
An optimization model may be specified all at once, by loading the
model from a file (using the appropriate
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel2.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> constructor), or built
incrementally, by first constructing an empty object of class
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel.html#dotnetclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> and then subsequently
calling <A HREF="cs_grbmodel_addvar.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.AddVar">GRBModel.AddVar</A>
or <A HREF="cs_grbmodel_addvars.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.AddVars">GRBModel.AddVars</A> to
add additional variables, and
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_addconstr.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.AddConstr">GRBModel.AddConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_addqconstr.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.AddQConstr">GRBModel.AddQConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_addsos.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.AddSOS">GRBModel.AddSOS</A>, or any of the
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_addgenconstrxx.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.AddGenConstrXxx">GRBModel.AddGenConstrXxx</A> methods
to add additional constraints.  Models are dynamic entities; you can
always add or remove variables or constraints.

<P>
We often refer to the <EM>class</EM> of an optimization model.  A
model with a linear objective function, linear constraints, and
continuous variables is a <EM>Linear Program (LP)</EM>.  If the
objective is quadratic, the model is a <EM>Quadratic Program
(QP)</EM>.  If any of the constraints are quadratic, the model is a
<EM>Quadratically-Constrained Program (QCP)</EM>.  We will
sometimes refer to a few special cases of QCP:
QCPs with convex constraints,
QCPs with non-convex constraints,
<EM>bilinear programs</EM>,
and <EM>Second-Order Cone Programs (SOCP)</EM>.
If the model contains any integer variables,
semi-continuous variables, semi-integer variables, Special Ordered Set
(SOS) constraints, or general constraints, the model is a
<EM>Mixed Integer Program (MIP)</EM>.  We'll also sometimes discuss
special cases of MIP, including <EM>Mixed Integer Linear Programs
(MILP)</EM>, <EM>Mixed Integer Quadratic Programs (MIQP)</EM>,
<EM>Mixed Integer Quadratically-Constrained Programs (MIQCP)</EM>, and
<EM>Mixed Integer Second-Order Cone Programs (MISOCP)</EM>.  The
Gurobi Optimizer handles all of these model classes.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Solving a Model</SPAN>

<P>
Once you have built a model, you can call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_optimize.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Optimize">GRBModel.Optimize</A> to
compute a solution.  By default,
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_optimize.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Optimize">Optimize</A>
will use the
<A HREF="concurrent_optimizer.html#sec:Concurrent">concurrent optimizer</A>
to solve LP models, the barrier algorithm to solve QP models
with convex objectives and
QCP models with convex constraints,
and the branch-and-cut algorithm otherwise.
The solution is stored in a set of <EM>  attributes</EM> of the model.  These attributes can be queried using a
set of attribute query methods on the
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel.html#dotnetclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbvar.html#dotnetclass:GRBVar">GRBVar</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbconstr.html#dotnetclass:GRBConstr">GRBConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbqconstr.html#dotnetclass:GRBQConstr">GRBQConstr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbsos.html#dotnetclass:GRBSOS">GRBSOS</A>, and
<A HREF="cs_grbgenconstr.html#dotnetclass:GRBGenConstr">GRBGenConstr</A>
classes.

<P>
The Gurobi algorithms keep careful track of the state of the model, so
calls to
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_optimize.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Optimize">GRBModel.Optimize</A>
will only perform further optimization if relevant data has changed
since the model was last optimized.  If you would like to discard
previously computed solution information and restart the optimization
from scratch without changing the model, you can call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_reset.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Reset">GRBModel.Reset</A>.

<P>
After a MIP model has been solved, you can call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_fixedmodel.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.FixedModel">GRBModel.FixedModel</A> to
compute the associated <EM>fixed</EM> model.  This model is identical
to the input model, except that all integer variables are fixed to
their values in the MIP solution.  In some applications, it is useful
to compute information on this continuous version of the MIP model
(e.g., dual variables, sensitivity information, etc.).

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Multiple Solutions, Objectives, and Scenarios</SPAN>

<P>
By default, the Gurobi Optimizer assumes that your goal is to find one
proven optimal solution to a single model with a single objective
function.  Gurobi provides the following features that allow you to
relax these assumptions:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="solution_pool.html#sec:SolutionPool">Solution Pool</A>: Allows you to
  find more solutions.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="multiple_scenarios.html#sec:MultipleScenarios">Multiple Scenarios</A>: Allows
  you to find solutions to multiple, related models.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="multiple_objectives.html#sec:MultipleObjectives">Multiple Objectives</A>: Allows
  you to specify multiple objective functions and control the
  trade-off between them.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Infeasible Models</SPAN>

<P>
You have a few options if a model is found to be infeasible.  You can
try to diagnose the cause of the infeasibility, attempt to repair the
infeasibility, or both.  To obtain information that can be useful for
diagnosing the cause of an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_computeiis.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.ComputeIIS">GRBModel.ComputeIIS</A>
to compute an
Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS).  This method can be used
for both continuous and MIP models, but you should be aware that the
MIP version can be quite expensive.  This method populates a set of
IIS attributes.

<P>
To attempt to repair an infeasibility, call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_feasrelax.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.FeasRelax">GRBModel.FeasRelax</A>
to compute a
feasibility relaxation for the model.  This relaxation allows you to
find a solution that minimizes the magnitude of the constraint
violation.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Querying and Modifying Attributes</SPAN>

<P>
Most of the information associated with a Gurobi model is stored in a
set of attributes.  Some attributes are associated with the variables
of the model, some with the constraints of the model, and some with
the model itself.  To give a simple example, solving an optimization
model causes the <code>X</code> variable attribute to be populated.
Attributes such as <code>X</code> that are computed by the Gurobi optimizer
cannot be modified directly by the user, while others, such as the
variable lower bound (the <code>LB</code> attribute) can.

<P>
Attributes can be accessed in two ways in the .NET interface.  The
easiest is through .NET properties.  To query or modify the <code>LB</code>
attribute on variable <code>v</code>, you would use <code>v.LB</code> or
<code>v.LB = 0</code>, respectively.  Attributes can also be queried using
<A HREF="cs_grbvar_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBVar.Get">GRBVar.Get</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbconstr_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBConstr.Get">GRBConstr.Get</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbqconstr_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBQConstr.Get">GRBQConstr.Get</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbsos_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBSOS.Get">GRBSOS.Get</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbgenconstr_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBGenConstr.Get">GRBGenConstr.Get</A>, or
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Get">GRBModel.Get</A>, and modified
using <A HREF="cs_grbvar_set.html#dotnetmethod:GRBVar.Set">GRBVar.Set</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbconstr_set.html#dotnetmethod:GRBConstr.Set">GRBConstr.Set</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbqconstr_set.html#dotnetmethod:GRBQConstr.Set">GRBQConstr.Set</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbgenconstr_set.html#dotnetmethod:GRBGenConstr.Set">GRBGenConstr.Set</A>, or
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_set.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Set">GRBModel.Set</A>.  Attributes
are grouped into a set of enums by type
(<A HREF="cs_grb_charattr.html#dotnetenum:GRB.CharAttr">GRB.CharAttr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grb_doubleattr.html#dotnetenum:GRB.DoubleAttr">GRB.DoubleAttr</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grb_intattr.html#dotnetenum:GRB.IntAttr">GRB.IntAttr</A>, 
<A HREF="cs_grb_stringattr.html#dotnetenum:GRB.StringAttr">GRB.StringAttr</A>).  The
<code>Get()</code> and <code>Set()</code> methods are overloaded, so the type of
the attribute determines the type of the returned value.  Thus,
<code>constr.Get(GRB.DoubleAttr.RHS)</code> returns a double, while
<code>constr.Get(GRB.CharAttr.Sense)</code> returns a char.

<P>
If you wish to retrieve attribute values for a set of variables or
constraints, it is usually more efficient to use the array methods on
the associated <A HREF="cs_grbmodel.html#dotnetclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> object.
Method
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_get.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Get">GRBModel.Get</A>
includes signatures that allow you to query or modify attribute values
for one-, two-, and three-dimensional arrays of variables or
constraints.

<P>
The full list of attributes can be found in the
<A HREF="attributes.html#sec:Attributes">Attributes</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Additional Model Modification Information</SPAN>

<P>
Most modifications to an existing model are done through the attribute
interface (e.g., changes to variable bounds, constraint right-hand
sides, etc.).  The main exceptions are modifications to the constraint
matrix and to the objective function.

<P>
The constraint matrix can be modified in a few ways.  The first is to
call the
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_chgcoeff.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.ChgCoeff">ChgCoeff</A> method on a
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel.html#dotnetclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> object to change individual
matrix coefficients.  This method can be used to modify the value of an
existing non-zero, to set an existing non-zero to zero, or to create a
new non-zero.  The constraint matrix is also modified when you remove
a variable or constraint from the model (through the
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_remove.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Remove">GRBModel.Remove</A> method).
The non-zero values associated with the deleted constraint or
variable are removed along with the constraint or variable itself.

<P>
The model objective function can also be modified in a few ways.  The
easiest is to build an expression that captures the objective function
(a <A HREF="cs_grblinexpr.html#dotnetclass:GRBLinExpr">GRBLinExpr</A> or
<A HREF="cs_grbquadexpr.html#dotnetclass:GRBQuadExpr">GRBQuadExpr</A> object),
and then pass that expression to method
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_setobjective.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.SetObjective">GRBModel.SetObjective</A>.
If you wish to modify the objective, you can simply call
<code>setObjective</code> again with a new <code>GRBLinExpr</code> or
<code>GRBQuadExpr</code> object.

<P>
For linear objective functions, an alternative to <code>SetObjective</code>
is to use the <code>Obj</code> variable attribute to modify individual
linear objective coefficients.

<P>
If your variables have piecewise-linear objectives, you can specify
them using the <A HREF="cs_grbmodel_setpwlobj.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.SetPWLObj">GRBModel.SetPWLObj</A>
method.  Call this method once for each relevant variable.  The Gurobi
simplex solver includes algorithmic support for convex
piecewise-linear objective functions, so for continuous models you
should see a substantial performance benefit from using this feature.
To clear a previously specified piecewise-linear objective function,
simply set the <code>Obj</code> attribute on the corresponding variable to
0.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Lazy Updates</SPAN>

<P>
One important item to note about model modification in the Gurobi
optimizer is that it is performed in a <EM>lazy</EM> fashion, meaning
that modifications don't affect the model immediately.  Rather, they
are queued and applied later.  If your program simply creates a model
and solves it, you will probably never notice this behavior.  However,
if you ask for information about the model before your modifications
have been applied, the details of the lazy update approach may be
relevant to you.

<P>
As we just noted, model modifications (bound changes, right-hand side
changes, objective changes, etc.) are placed in a queue.  These queued
modifications can be applied to the model in three different ways.
The first is by an explicit call to
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_update.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Update">GRBModel.Update</A>.  The second is
by a call to <A HREF="cs_grbmodel_optimize.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Optimize">GRBModel.Optimize</A>.  The
third is by a call to <A HREF="cs_grbmodel_write.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Write">GRBModel.Write</A> to
write out the model.  The first case gives you fine-grained control
over when modifications are applied.  The second and third make the
assumption that you want all pending modifications to be applied
before you optimize your model or write it to disk.

<P>
Why does the Gurobi interface behave in this manner?  There are a few
reasons.  The first is that this approach makes it much easier to
perform multiple modifications to a model, since the model remains
unchanged between modifications.  The second is that processing model
modifications can be expensive, particularly in a Compute Server
environment, where modifications require communication between
machines.  Thus, it is useful to have visibility into exactly when
these modifications are applied.  In general, if your program needs to
make multiple modifications to the model, you should aim to make them
in phases, where you make a set of modifications, then update, then
make more modifications, then update again, etc.  Updating after each
individual modification can be extremely expensive.

<P>
If you forget to call update, your program won't crash.  Your query
will simply return the value of the requested data from the point of
the last update.  If the object you tried to query didn't exist then,
you'll get a <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">NOT_IN_MODEL</SPAN> exception instead.

<P>
The semantics of lazy updates have changed since earlier Gurobi
versions.  While the vast majority of programs are unaffected by this
change, you can use the <A HREF="updatemode.html#parameter:UpdateMode">UpdateMode</A>
parameter to revert to the earlier behavior if you run into an issue.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Managing Parameters</SPAN>

<P>
The Gurobi optimizer provides a set of parameters that allow you to
control many of the details of the optimization process.  Factors like
feasibility and optimality tolerances, choices of algorithms,
strategies for exploring the MIP search tree, etc., can be controlled
by modifying Gurobi parameters before beginning the optimization.
Parameters can be of type <EM>int</EM>, <EM>double</EM>, or <EM>string</EM>.

<P>
The simplest way to set parameters is through the
<code>Model.Parameters</code> class and its associated .NET properties.  To
set the <A HREF="mipgap2.html#parameter:MIPGap">MIPGap</A> parameter to 0.0 for
model <code>m</code>, for example, you would do
<code>m.Parameters.MIPGap = 0</code>.

<P>
Parameters can also be set on the Gurobi environment object, using
<A HREF="cs_grbenv_set.html#dotnetmethod:GRBEnv.Set">GRBEnv.Set</A>.  Note that each
model gets its own copy of the environment when it is created, so
parameter changes to the original environment have no effect on
existing models.

<P>
You can read a set of parameter settings from a file using
<A HREF="cs_grbenv_readparams.html#dotnetmethod:GRBEnv.ReadParams">GRBEnv.ReadParams</A>, or
write the set of changed parameters using
<A HREF="cs_grbenv_writeparams.html#dotnetmethod:GRBEnv.WriteParams">GRBEnv.WriteParams</A>.

<P>
We also include an automated parameter tuning tool that explores many
different sets of parameter changes in order to find a set that
improves performance.  You can call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_tune.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Tune">GRBModel.Tune</A>
to invoke the tuning tool on a model.
Refer to the
<A HREF="parameter_tuning_tool.html#sec:Tuning">parameter tuning tool</A>
section for more information.

<P>
The full list of Gurobi parameters can be found in the
<A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">Parameters</A> section.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Memory Management</SPAN>

<P>
Users typically do not need to concern themselves with memory
management in .NET, since it is handled automatically by the garbage
collector.  The Gurobi .NET interface utilizes the same garbage
collection mechanism as other .NET programs, but there are a few
specifics of our memory management that users should be aware of.

<P>
In general, Gurobi objects live in the same .NET heap as other .NET
objects.  When they are no longer referenced, they become candidates
for garbage collection, and are returned to the pool of free space at
the next invocation of the garbage collector.  Two important exceptions
are the
<A HREF="cs_grbenv.html#dotnetclass:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> and
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel.html#dotnetclass:GRBModel">GRBModel</A> objects.
A <code>GRBModel</code> object has a small amount of memory associated with
it in the .NET heap, but the majority of the space associated with a
model lives in the heap of the Gurobi native code DLL.  The
.NET heap manager is unaware of the memory associated with the model
in the native code library, so it does not consider this memory usage
when deciding whether to invoke the garbage collector.  When the
garbage collector eventually collects the .NET <code>GRBModel</code>
object, the memory associated with the model in the Gurobi native
code library will be freed, but this collection may come later than
you might want.  Similar considerations apply to the <code>GRBEnv</code>
object.

<P>
If you are writing a .NET program that makes use of multiple Gurobi
models or environments, we recommend that you call
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_dispose.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Dispose">GRBModel.Dispose</A>
when you are done using the associated <code>GRBModel</code> object,
and
<A HREF="cs_grbenv_dispose.html#dotnetmethod:GRBEnv.Dispose">GRBEnv.Dispose</A>
when you are done using the associated
<code>GRBEnv</code> object and after you have called
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_dispose.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.Dispose">GRBModel.Dispose</A> on
all of the models created using that <code>GRBEnv</code> object.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Native Code</SPAN>

<P>
As noted earlier, the Gurobi .NET interface is a thin layer that sits
on top of our native code DLL.  Thus, an application that uses the
Gurobi .NET library will load the Gurobi DLL at runtime.  In order for
this happen, you need to make sure that two things are true.  First,
you need to make sure that the native code library is available in the
<code>PATH</code> environment library.  This environment variable is set up as part of
the installation of the Gurobi Optimizer, but it may not be configured
appropriately on a machine where the full Gurobi Optimizer has not
been installed.  Second, you need to be sure that the selected .NET
Platform Target (as selected in Visual Studio) is compatible with the
Gurobi DLL that is available through your <code>PATH</code>.  In particular,
you need to use the 64-bit Gurobi native library when you've selected
the <code>x64</code> Platform Target.  If you use the default <code>Any CPU</code>
target, then your .NET application will look for the 64-bit Gurobi DLL
on a 64-bit machine.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Monitoring Progress - Logging and Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Progress of the optimization can be monitored through Gurobi logging.
By default, Gurobi will send output to the screen.  A few simple
controls are available for modifying the default logging behavior.  If
you would like to direct output to a file as well as to the screen,
specify the log file name in the <A HREF="cs_grbenv2.html#dotnetmethod:GRBEnv">GRBEnv</A> constructor.  You can modify the
<A HREF="logfile.html#parameter:LogFile">LogFile</A>
parameter if you wish to redirect the log to a
different file after creating the environment object.  The frequency
of logging output can be controlled with the
<A HREF="displayinterval.html#parameter:DisplayInterval">DisplayInterval</A>
parameter, and logging can be turned off entirely with the
<A HREF="outputflag.html#parameter:OutputFlag">OutputFlag</A>
parameter.  A detailed description of the Gurobi log
file can be found in the <A HREF="logging.html#sec:Logging">Logging</A> section.

<P>
More detailed progress monitoring can be done through the
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback.html#dotnetclass:GRBCallback">GRBCallback</A> class.
The
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_setcallback.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.SetCallback">GRBModel.SetCallback</A> method
allows you to receive a periodic callback from the Gurobi optimizer.
You do this by sub-classing
the <A HREF="cs_grbcallback.html#dotnetclass:GRBCallback">GRBCallback</A> abstract class,
and writing your own <code>Callback()</code> method on this class.  You can
call
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_getdoublein.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.GetDoubleInfo">GRBCallback.GetDoubleInfo</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_getintinfo.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.GetIntInfo">GRBCallback.GetIntInfo</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_getstringin.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.GetStringInfo">GRBCallback.GetStringInfo</A>,
or
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_getsolution.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.GetSolution">GRBCallback.GetSolution</A>
from within the callback to obtain additional information about the
state of the optimization.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Modifying Solver Behavior - Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Callbacks can also be used to modify the behavior of the Gurobi
optimizer.  The simplest control callback is
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_abort.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.Abort">GRBCallback.Abort</A>,
which asks the optimizer to terminate at the earliest convenient
point.  Method
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_setsolution.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.SetSolution">GRBCallback.SetSolution</A>
allows you to inject a feasible solution (or partial solution) during
the solution of a MIP model.  Methods
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_addcut.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.AddCut">GRBCallback.AddCut</A>
and
<A HREF="cs_grbcallback_addlazy.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.AddLazy">GRBCallback.AddLazy</A>
allow you to add <EM>cutting planes</EM> and <EM>lazy constraints</EM>
during a MIP optimization, respectively.
Method <A HREF="cs_grbcallback_stoponemult.html#dotnetmethod:GRBCallback.StopOneMultiObj">GRBCallback.StopOneMultiObj</A> allows you to interrupt the optimization process of one of the optimization steps in
a multi-objective MIP problem without stopping the hierarchical
optimization process.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Batch Optimization</SPAN>

<P>
Gurobi Compute Server enables programs to offload
  optimization computations onto dedicated servers.
  The Gurobi Cluster Manager adds a number of additional
  capabilities on top of this.  One important one,
  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">batch optimization</SPAN>, allows you to build an
  optimization model with your client program,
  submit it to a Compute Server cluster (through the Cluster
  Manager), and later check on the status of the model
  and retrieve its solution.  You can use a
  <A HREF="cs_grbbatch.html#dotnetclass:GRBBatch">Batch object</A> to make it easier to
  work with batches.
  For details on batches, please refer to the
  <A HREF="batch_optimization.html#sec:BatchOptimization">Batch Optimization</A>
  section.

<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Error Handling</SPAN>

<P>
All of the methods in the Gurobi .NET library can throw an exception
of type <A HREF="cs_grbexception.html#dotnetclass:GRBException">GRBException</A>.  When an
exception occurs, additional information on the error can be obtained
by retrieving the error code (using property
<A HREF="cs_grbexception_errorcode.html#dotnetmethod:GRBException.ErrorCode">GRBException.ErrorCode</A>),
or by retrieving the exception message (using property
<code>GRBException.Message</code> from the parent class).  The list of possible
error return codes can be found in the <A HREF="error_codes.html#sec:ErrorCodes">Error
Codes</A> section.
