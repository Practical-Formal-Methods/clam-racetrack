Tips and Tricks
</H2>

<P>
Through clever use of the features provided in the multi-scenario
interface, it is actually possible to do a lot more than it may first
appear.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Adding or Deleting Variables or Constraints</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
The multi-scenario interface provides no way to add or remove
variables or constraints in a scenario, but the same effect can be
achieved by changing variable bounds and constraint right-hand side
values.  To remove a variable in a scenario, simply change its lower
and upper bounds to zero.  To add a variable, set its bounds to zero
in the base model and change them to their true values in the
scenario.  To remove a less-than constraint, change the
right-hand-value in the scenario to <code>GRB.INFINITY</code>.  To add one,
set its right-hand side to <code>GRB.INFINITY</code> in the base model and
change it to its true value in the scenario.

<P>
Changing the sense of a constraint can also be done using similar
tricks.  For example, you can transform an equality constraint in the
base model into an inequality in a scenario by splitting the equality
into a pair of inequalities.  The right-hand side values for both
inequalities in the base model would be equal to the true value in the
equality.  The right-hand side value on one of the two inequalities
can then be relaxed to <code>GRB.INFINITY</code> in the scenario.

<P>
You can also change the type of a variable.  For example, to transform
an integer variable in the base model into a continuous variable in a
scenario, you can add both variables in the base model, along with a
split equality constraint that sets them equal to each other.  That
equality constraint could then be relaxed in the scenario (using the
techniques just described).

<P>
This isn't meant to be an exhaustive list of all of the ways that you
can use supported multi-scenario features to achieve seemingly
unsupported outcomes.  The set of building blocks that we have
provided can be assembled in a variety of different ways.

<P>
If all scenarios in your multi-scenario model are infeasible, your
<code>optimize</code> call will produce an <code>INFEASIBLE</code> (or
<code>INF_OR_UNBD</code>) status code.  While you can't compute an IIS on a
multi-scenario model, you can extract individual scenarios as Gurobi
model objects using the <code>singleScenarioModel</code> method (see below)
and then compute an IIS on each scenario individually.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Solving The Base Model</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
As noted earlier, an <code>optimize</code> call on a multi-scenario model
will not solve the base model.  If you'd like to solve that model too,
include an empty scenario among your scenarios.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Extracting One Scenario</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
If you'd like to extract one scenario from a multi-scenario model,
you can use the <code>singleScenarioModel</code> method
(in
<A HREF="c_grbsinglescenariomodel.html#routine:GRBsinglescenariomodel">C</A>,
<A HREF="cpp_grbmodel_singlescenari.html#cppmethod:GRBModel::singleScenarioModel">C++</A>,
<A HREF="ja_grbmodel_singlescenario.html#javamethod:GRBModel.singleScenarioModel">Java</A>,
<A HREF="cs_grbmodel_singlescenario.html#dotnetmethod:GRBModel.SingleScenarioModel">.NET</A>, and
<A HREF="py_model_singlescenariomod.html#pythonmethod:Model.singleScenarioModel">Python</A>).

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Performance Considerations</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
While it may appear to be important to minimize the number of
scenarios in your model, note that some scenarios are trivial to solve
and thus have no impact on overall solution cost.  The main thing to
keep in mind is that, if (1) the solution for one scenario is feasible
for another scenario, and (2) the bounds and right-hand side values
for the first scenario are never tighter than the bounds for the other
scenario, then the optimal solution for the first scenario is also
optimal for the other scenario.  This means that some scenarios won't
increase solution cost significantly.
