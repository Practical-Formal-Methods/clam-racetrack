Connecting Nodes
</H3>

<P>
Every Remote Services cluster starts with a single node. The steps for
starting Remote Services on a single node, either as a
<A HREF="starting_a_cluster_node_as.html#sec:RSMNodeStartProcess">standard process</A> or as a
<A HREF="starting_a_cluster_node_as2.html#sec:RSMNodeStartService">service</A>, were covered in earlier
sections.

<P>
Before adding nodes into your cluster, you first need to make sure
that the cluster token (property <TT>CLUSTER_TOKEN</TT> in the
configuration file) has the same value in each node and in the Cluster Manager.
For better
security, we recommend that you change the predefined value of the
token by generating a new one and pasting the same value into each
node configuration file.  You can generate a new token with the
following command:

<PRE>
&gt; grb_rs token
GRBTK-6o4xujs59WJO5508nmaNwc1TtjZJAL1UcwN4vTD4qK4nata8oLr9GnubyXrLTkggc/aw2A==
</PRE>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Adding nodes with a Cluster Manager</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
If you have started a Cluster Manager, you add additional nodes using
the exact same command you used to add the first node.  You do this by
providing the Cluster Manager address.  The Cluster Manager acts as a
registry of nodes of your cluster, and the nodes will then connect
between themselves.

<P>

<PRE>
&gt; grb_rs --manager=http://mymanager:61080 --port=61000
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>MANAGER</TT> property can also be set through
the configuration file:

<PRE>
MANAGER=http://mymanager:61080
PORT=61000
</PRE>
You won't have the opportunity to provide command-line
options when starting <TT>grb_rs</TT> as a service, so your only
option in this case is to provide this information through the
configuration file.

<P>
If you wish to start multiple <TT>grb_rs</TT> processes on the same
machine for testing purposes (this is not recommended for production
use), you will need to make sure each instance of <TT>grb_rs</TT> is started on a
different port and using a different data directory. The command <TT>grb_rs init</TT>
will help you by copying the default configuration and the data directory into a current
directory.

<P>
For example, to start two nodes on the same machine with a hostname of <TT>myserver</TT>:

<OL>
<LI>In a first terminal window, create a new directory <TT>node1</TT>,
</LI>
<LI>Change your current directory to <TT>node1</TT> and run <TT>grb_rs init</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Start the first node:

<PRE>
grb_rs --manager=http://mymanager:61080 --port=61000
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In a second terminal window, create a new directory <TT>node2</TT>,
</LI>
<LI>Change your current directory to <TT>node2</TT> and run <TT>grb_rs init</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Start the second node on a different port and connect to the Cluster Manager:

<PRE>
grb_rs --manager=http://mymanager:61080 --port=61001
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Adding nodes to a Self-Managed Cluster</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
If you have not started a Cluster Manager, nodes must be connected to each other.
Once you've started a single-node cluster, you can add nodes using the
<TT>--join</TT> flag to <TT>grb_rs</TT> or the <TT>JOIN</TT> configuration
property.  For example, if you've already started a cluster on the
default port of <TT>server1</TT>, you would run the following command on
the new node (call it <TT>server2</TT>) to create a two-node cluster:

<PRE>
&gt; grb_rs --join=server1
</PRE>

<P>
In the log output for <TT>server2</TT>, you should see the result of the
handshake between the servers:

<PRE>
info  : Node server1, transition from JOINING to ALIVE
</PRE>

<P>
Similarly, the log output of <TT>server1</TT> will include the line:

<PRE>
info  : Node server2, added to the cluster
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using a non-default port, you can specify the target node
port as part of the node URL in the <TT>--join</TT> flag.
You can specify the port of the current node using the <TT>  --port</TT> flag.  You can use different ports on
different machines, but it is a good practice to use the same one
(port 61000 is typically a good choice).  The command
would look like this:

<PRE>
&gt; grb_rs --join=server1:61000 --port=61000
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>JOIN</TT> property can also be set through the
configuration file:

<PRE>
JOIN=server1:61000
PORT=61000
</PRE>
Again, you won't have the opportunity to provide command-line
options when starting <TT>grb_rs</TT> as a service, so your only
option in this case is to provide this information through the
configuration file.

<P>
Once you've created a multi-node cluster, you can add additional nodes
by doing a <TT>JOIN</TT> with any member node.  Furthermore, the
<TT>--join</TT> flag or the <TT>JOIN</TT> property can
take a comma-separated list of node names, so a node can still join a
cluster even if one of the member nodes is unavailable.  Note that
when a list of nodes is specified, the joining node will try to join
with all of the specified nodes at the same time. Joining is an
asynchronous process, so if some target nodes are not reachable, the
joining node will retry before giving up on joining. If all of the
nodes are reachable, they will all join and form a single cluster.

<P>
If you wish to start multiple <TT>grb_rs</TT> processes on the
same machine for testing purposes (this is not recommended for
production use), you will need to make sure each instance of
<TT>grb_rs</TT> is started on a different port and using a
different data directory. The command <TT>grb_rs init</TT> will
help you by copying the default configuration and the data directory
into a current directory.

<P>
For example, to start two nodes on the same machine with a hostname of <TT>myserver</TT>:

<OL>
<LI>In a first terminal window, create a new directory <TT>node1</TT>,
</LI>
<LI>Change your current directory to <TT>node1</TT> and run <TT>grb_rs init</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Start the first node:

<PRE>
grb_rs --port=61000
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In a second terminal window, create a new directory <TT>node2</TT>,
</LI>
<LI>Change your current directory to <TT>node2</TT> and run <TT>grb_rs init</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Start the second node on a different port and join the first node:

<PRE>
grb_rs --port=61001 --join=myserver:61000
</PRE>

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Checking the status of your cluster</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="sec:RSMNodeCheck"></A>
<P>
You can use <TT>grbcluster</TT> to check the status of the cluster:

<PRE>
&gt; grbcluster nodes
ID       ADDRESS       STATUS TYPE    LICENSE PROCESSING #Q #R JL IDLE %MEM  %CPU
b7d037db server1:61000 ALIVE  COMPUTE VALID   ACCEPTING  0  0  10 &lt;1s  61.42 9.72
eb07fe16 server2:61000 ALIVE  COMPUTE VALID   ACCEPTING  0  0  8  &lt;1s  61.42 8.82
</PRE>
The nodes of the cluster constantly share information about their status.
Each node can be in one of the following states:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ALIVE</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The node is up and running.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>DEGRADED</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The node failed to respond to recent communications.
  The node could return to the <TT>ALIVE</TT> state if it becomes
  reachable again.  The node will stay in this state until a timeout
  (controlled by the configuration property <TT>    DEGRADED_TIMEOUT</TT>), at which point it is considered as <TT>    FAILED</TT>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>FAILED</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The node has been in <TT>DEGRADED</TT> state for too long,
  and has been flagged as <TT>FAILED</TT>.
  A node will remain in the <TT>FAILED</TT> state for a short time, and it
  will eventually be removed from the cluster.  If the node comes back
  online, it will not re-join the cluster automatically.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>JOINING</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The node is in the process of joining the cluster.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>LEAVING</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The node left the cluster.  It will stay in that state
  for a short time period before being removed from the cluster.
</DD>
</DL>
