Queueing, Load Balancing, and Job Priorities
</H3>

<P>
As noted earlier, Gurobi Compute Servers support job priorities.  You
can assign an integer priority between -100 and 100 to each job (the
default is 0).  When choosing among queued jobs, the Compute Server
will run the highest priority job first.  Note that servers will never
preempt running jobs. You can set the priority in the client license
file, or using the <TT>PRIORITY</TT> parameter in the programming
language APIs.

<P>
We have chosen to give priority 100 a special meaning.  A priority 100
job will start immediately, even if this means that a server will
exceed its job limit.  You should be cautious with priority 100 jobs,
since submitting too many at once could lead to very high server
loads, which could lead to poor performance and even crashes in extreme
cases. Note that this feature must be enabled by the system administrator
using the <TT>HARDJOBLIMIT</TT> configuration property.

<P>
With the Remote Services grouping feature, the system administrator may
have assigned groups to the cluster nodes. This can be quite useful when some nodes
in the cluster are different from others. For example, some nodes may
have more memory or faster CPUs.  Using this feature, you can force
jobs to only run on the appropriate type of machines. If all nodes
of the requested group are at capacity, jobs will be queued until a
member of that group is available.

<P>
You can submit an optimization job to a given group by
using the <TT>GROUP</TT> property of
the client license file. You can also set the
<TT>CSGROUP</TT> parameter in the programming interface.

<P>
You can use this parameter to target a single group or a list of
groups, and you can specify a priority for each group.  Here is an
example that shows how you would use this parameter to submit a
job to group1 with priority 10 and to group2 with priority 50.

<PRE>
group1:10,group2:50
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if no group specified for the submitted job, the job can run
on any node.
