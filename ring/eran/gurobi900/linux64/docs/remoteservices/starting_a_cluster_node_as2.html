Starting a Cluster Node as a Service
</H3>

<P>
While you always have the option of running <TT>grb_rs</TT> from a
terminal and leaving the process running in the background, we
recommended that you start it as a service instead, especially in a
production deployment.  The advantage of a service is that it will
automatically restart itself if the computer is restarted or if the
process terminates unexpectedly.

<P>
<TT>grb_rs</TT> provides several commands that help you to set it up as
a service.  These must be executed with administrator privileges:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>grb_rs install</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Install the service.  The details of exactly what this
  involves depend on the host operating system type and version: this
  uses <TT>systemd</TT> or <TT>upstart</TT> on Linux, <TT>launchd</TT> on
  Mac OS, and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Windows services</SPAN> on Windows.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>grb_rs start</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Start the service (and install it if it hasn't already
  been installed).
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>grb_rs stop</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Stop the service.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>grb_rs restart</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Stop and then start the service.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>grb_rs uninstall</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Uninstall the service.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Note that the <TT>install</TT> command installs the service using
default settings.  If you don't need to modify any of these, you can
use the <TT>start</TT> command to both install and start the service.
Otherwise, run <TT>install</TT> to register the service, then modify
the configuration (the details are platform-dependent and are touched
on below), and then run <TT>start</TT> the service.

<P>
Note that you only need to start the service once; <TT>grb_rs</TT> will
keep running until you execute the <TT>grb_rs stop</TT> command.  In
particular, it will start again automatically if you restart the
machine.

<P>
Note also that the <TT>start</TT> command does not take any flags
or additional parameters.  All of the configuration properties must be
set in the <TT>grb_rs.cnf</TT> configuration file.  If you need to
make a change, edit the configuration file, then use the <TT>  stop</TT> command followed by the <TT>start</TT> command to restart
<TT>grb_rs</TT> with the updated configuration.

<P>
The one exception is the <TT>JOBLIMIT</TT> property, which can be
changed on a live server using <TT>grbcluster</TT>.  If you change
this property and later restart the server, the new value will persist
and the value in the configuration file will be ignored.

<P>
The exact behavior of these commands varies depending on the host
operating system and version:

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Linux</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
On Linux, <TT>grb_rs</TT> supports two major service managers:
<TT>systemd</TT> and <TT>upstart</TT>.  The <TT>install</TT> command will
detect the service manager available on your system and will generate
a service configuration file located in
<TT>/etc/systemd/system/grb_rs.service</TT> or
<TT>/etc/init/grb_rs.conf</TT> for <TT>systemd</TT> and <TT>upstart</TT>,
respectively.  Once the file is generated, you can edit it to set
advanced properties.  Please refer to the documentation of
<TT>systemd</TT> or <TT>upstart</TT> to learn more about service
configuration.

<P>
Use the <TT>start</TT> and <TT>stop</TT> commands to start and stop the
service.  When the service is running, log messages are sent to
the Linux <code>syslog</code> and to a rotating log file, <TT>service.log</TT>,
located in the same directory as <TT>grb_rs</TT>.

<P>
The <TT>uninstall</TT> command will delete the generated file.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Mac OS</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
On Mac OS, the system manager is called <TT>launchd</TT>, and the
<TT>install</TT> command will generate a service file in
<TT>/Library/LaunchDaemons/grb_rs.plist</TT>.  Once the file is
generated, you can edit it to set advanced properties.  Please refer
to the <TT>launchd</TT> documentation to learn more about service
configuration.

<P>
Use the <TT>start</TT> and <TT>stop</TT> commands to start and stop the
service.  When the service is running, log messages are sent to
the Mac OS <code>syslog</code> and to a rotating log file, <TT>service.log</TT>,
located in the same directory as <TT>grb_rs</TT>.

<P>
The <TT>uninstall</TT> command will delete the generated file.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Windows</SPAN></SPAN>

<P>
On Windows, the <TT>install</TT> command will declare the service to the
operating system.  If you wish to set advanced properties for the
service configuration, you will need to start the <TT>Services</TT>
configuration application.  Please refer to the Windows Operating
System documentation for more details.

<P>
Use the <TT>start</TT> and <TT>stop</TT> commands to start and stop the
service.  When the service is running, log messages are sent to
the Windows event log and to a rotating log file, <TT>service.log</TT>,
located in the same directory as <TT>grb_rs</TT>.
Note that the service must run as a user that has write
permissions to this directory; otherwise, no log file will be
generated.

<P>
The <TT>uninstall</TT> command will delete the service from the registry.
