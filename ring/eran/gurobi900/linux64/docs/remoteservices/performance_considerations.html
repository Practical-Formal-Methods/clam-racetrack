Performance Considerations on a Wide-Area Network (WAN)
</H2>

<P>
While using Gurobi Compute Server doesn't typically require you to
make any modifications to your code, performance considerations can
sometimes force you to do some tuning when your client and server are
connected by a slow network (e.g., the internet).  We'll briefly talk
about the source of the issue, and the changes required to work around
it.

<P>
In a Gurobi Compute Server, a call to a Gurobi routine can result in a
network message between the client and the server.  An individual
message is not that expensive, but sending hundreds or thousands of
messages could be quite time-consuming.  Compute Server does a few
things to reduce the number of such messages.  First, it makes heavy
use of caching.  If you request an attribute on a single variable, for
example, the client library will retrieve and store the value of that
attribute for all variables, so subsequent requests won't require
additional communication.  In addition, our <EM>lazy update</EM>
approach to model building allows us to buffer additions and
modifications to the model, You can feel free to build your model one
constraint at a time, for example.  Your changes are communicated to
the server in one large message when you request a model update.

<P>
Having said that, we should add that not all methods are cached or
buffered.  As a result, we suggest that you avoid doing the following
things:

<UL>
<LI>Retrieving the non-zero values for individual rows and columns
  of the constraint matrix (using, for example, <TT>GRBgetconstrs</TT>
  in C, <TT>GRBModel::getRow</TT> in C++, <TT>GBModel.getRow</TT> in Java,
  <TT>GRBModel.GetRow</TT> in .NET, and <TT>Model.getRow</TT> in Python).
</LI>
<LI>Retrieving individual string-valued attributes.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Of course, network overhead depends on both the number of messages
that are sent and the sizes of these messages.  We automatically
perform data compression to reduce the time spent transferring very
large messages.  However, as you may expect, you will notice some lag
when solving very large models over slow networks.

<P>
