Using a Router without a Cluster Manager
</H3>

<P>
If you are installing a self-managed cluster, the clients need to have
direct access to each node in the cluster, including the node DNS name
and IP address. A Remote Services Router provides a point of contact
for all clients and will route the communication to the appropriate
node in the cluster, thus allowing you to isolate your cluster from
its clients. A Remote Services Router acts as a reverse proxy.  Behind
a router, the cluster nodes can use private DNS names or IP addresses
as long as all of the nodes and the router can communicate
together. Only the router must be accessible from the clients.

<P>
The router can use either HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with clients,
and similarly it can choose either to route traffic to cluster
nodes. It is a common to enable HTTPS between the clients and the
router, while having the router and the nodes communicate over
unencrypted HTTP in a private network. Using this setup only requires
you to manage certificates on the router.

<P>
You can get more information about the router (<TT>grb_rsr</TT>) by reading the command-line help:

<PRE>
grb_rsr --help
</PRE>

<P>
The router uses a configuration file <TT>grb_rsr.cnf</TT> that must be placed in the same directory as
the <TT>grb_rsr</TT> executable. A predefined configuration file with additional comments is provided.
The following command lists the available configuration properties:

<PRE>
grb_rsr properties
</PRE>

<P>
Similarly to <TT>grb_rs</TT>, the router can be started as a service and log messages will be stored in the
<TT>grbrsr-service.log</TT> rotating file by default. Log messages will also be sent to the <code>syslog</code> on Mac and Linux,
and to the service event log on Windows.

<PRE>
grb_rsr start
</PRE>

<P>
Here are some examples of how you might refer to a router using a URL (using HTTP or HTTPS, with the standard port or a custom port):

<PRE>
http://router.mycompany.com
http://router.mycompany.com:61001
https://router.mycompany.com
https://router.mycompany.com:61001
</PRE>

<P>
When using the command-line tools <TT>grbcluster</TT> or <TT>gurobi_cl</TT>, you can first
log in with a router. The router address will be saved in your license file in the <TT>ROUTER</TT>
property so that you can run other commands without needing to specify it again:

<P>

<PRE>
&gt; grbcluster login --server=http://server1:61000 --router=http://router.mycompany.com
info  : Using client license file '/home/jones/gurobi.lic'
Enter password (return to use default):
info  : Connected to node http://server1:61000 via router http://router.mycompany.com

&gt; grbcluster nodes
ID       ADDRESS               STATUS TYPE    LICENSE PROCESSING #Q #R JL IDLE %MEM  %CPU
b7d037db https://server1:61000 ALIVE  COMPUTE VALID   ACCEPTING  0  0  10 &lt;1s  66.58 7.97
eb07fe16 https://server2:61000 ALIVE  COMPUTE VALID   ACCEPTING  0  0  1  &lt;1s  66.58 9.62
</PRE>

<P>
For the clients using the Gurobi Optimizer API, you will need to
either set the <TT>ROUTER</TT> property in the license file or construct
an empty environment and set the <TT>CSRouter</TT> parameter before
starting the environment.

<P>
For clients using the cluster REST API for monitoring purpose, you
will need to use the router URL instead of a node address, and you can
pass the selected node address in the header <TT>  X-GUROBI-SERVER</TT>.  In this way, the client communicates with the
router and the router will use the header value to forward the request
to the selected node. In case the node address is incorrect or does
not exist, the router will return the HTTP error code 502.
