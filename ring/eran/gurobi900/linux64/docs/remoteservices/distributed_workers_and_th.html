Distributed Workers and the Distributed Manager
</H3>

<P>
Running distributed algorithms requires several machines.  One acts as
the manager, coordinating the activities of the set of machines, and
the others act as workers, receiving tasks from the manager.  The
manager typically acts as a worker itself, although not always.  More
machines generally produce better performance, although the marginal
benefit of an additional machine typically falls off as you add more.

<P>
As we mentioned <A HREF="compute_servers_and_distri.html#sec:RSMNodeTypes">earlier</A>, Distributed
Workers do not require Gurobi licenses.  You can add any machine to a
Remote Services cluster to act as a Distributed Worker.  The manager
does require a distributed algorithm license (you'll see a
<TT>DISTRIBUTED=</TT> line in your license file if distributed
algorithms are enabled).

<P>
A typical distributed optimization will look like the following, with
all machines belonging to the same Remote Services cluster:
<DIV class="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{graphics/distributed2}}$
 -->
<IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img10.svg"
 ALT="\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{graphics/distributed2}}">
</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV>
The workload associated with managing distributed algorithms is quite
light, so a machine can handle both the manager and worker roles
without degrading performance.

<P>
Another option is to use a machine outside of your Remote Services
cluster as the manager:
<DIV class="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 $\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/distributed}}$
 -->
<IMG STYLE=""
 SRC="img11.svg"
 ALT="\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[width=3in]{graphics/distributed}}">
</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
</DIV>

<P>
Note that we only allow a machine to act as manager for a single
distributed job.  If you want to run multiple distributed jobs
simultaneously, you'll need multiple manager machines.
