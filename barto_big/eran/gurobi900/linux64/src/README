The files in this directory allow you to build the Gurobi C++
interface (libgurobi_c++.a) from source.  These files should only be
used by advanced users.  We provide no technical support for the
included source code, nor do we provide assistance in building or
using the resulting library.

To build libgurobi_c++.a, change to the 'build' directory and type 'make'.

To use the result, modify the Makefile for your project to link with
'libgurobi_c++.a' (which you'll find in the 'build' directory).
