Distributed Algorithm Considerations
</H2>

<P>
The distributed algorithms have been designed to be nearly
indistinguishable from the single machine versions.  Our hope is that,
if you know how to use the single machine version, you'll find it
straightforward to use the distributed version.  The distributed
algorithms respect all of the usual parameters.  For distributed MIP,
you can adjust strategies, adjust tolerances, set limits, etc.  For
concurrent MIP, you can allow Gurobi to choose the settings for each
machine automatically or you can use <TT>concurrent
  environments</TT> to make your own choices.  For distributed tuning, you
can use the usual tuning parameters, including <TT>  TuneTimeLimit</TT>, <TT>TuneTrials</TT>, and <TT>TuneOutput</TT>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Performance Across Distributed Workers</SPAN>

<P>
There are a few things to be aware of when using distributed
algorithms, though.  One relates to relative machine performance.  As
we noted earlier, distributed algorithms work best if all of the
workers give very similar performance.  For example, if one machine in
your worker pool were much slower than the others in a distributed
tuning run, any parameter sets tested on the slower machine would
appear to be less effective than if they were run on a faster machine.
Similar considerations apply for distributed MIP and distributed
concurrent.  We strongly recommend that you use machines with very
similar performance.  Note that if your machines have similarly
performing cores but different numbers of cores, we suggest that you
use the <TT>Threads</TT> parameter to make
sure that all machines use the same number of cores.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Callbacks</SPAN>

<P>
Another difference between the distributed algorithms and our
single-machine algorithms is in the callbacks.  The
distributed MIP and distributed concurrent solvers do not
provide the full range of callbacks that are available with our
standard solvers.  They will only provide the <TT>MIP</TT>,
<TT>MIPNODE</TT>, and <TT>POLLING</TT> callbacks.
See the
<TT>Callback</TT> section of the
<A ID="tex2html14"
  HREF="../refman/refman.html">Gurobi Reference Manual</A>)
for details on the different callback types.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Logging</SPAN>

<P>
The distributed algorithms provide slightly different logging
information from the standard algorithms.  Consult the
<TT>Distributed MIP Logging</TT>
section of the
<A ID="tex2html15"
  HREF="../refman/refman.html">Gurobi Reference Manual</A>)
for details.
