Variables
</H2>

<P>
Decision variables capture the results of the optimization.  In a
feasible solution, the computed values for the decision variables
satisfy all of the model constraints.  Some of these constraints are
associated with individual variables (e.g., variable bounds), while
others capture relationships between variables.  We'll first consider
the different types of decision variables that can be added to a
Gurobi model, and the implicit and explicit constraints associated
with these variable types.

<P>
Before starting, we should point out one important thing about the
variables in a mathematical programming model: their computed solution
values will only satisfy bounds <EM>to tolerances</EM>, meaning that a
variable may violate its stated bounds.  Mathematical programming is
fundamentally built on top of linear algebra and in particular on the
numerical solution of systems of linear equations.  These linear
systems are solved using finite-precision arithmetic, which means that
small errors are unavoidable.  For some models, large errors are
unavoidable too; we'll return to that topic later in this section.

<P>
The available variables types are
<A HREF="#subsubsection:ContVars">continuous</A>,
<A HREF="#subsubsection:IntVars">general integer</A>,
<A HREF="#subsubsection:BinVars">binary</A>,
<A HREF="#subsubsection:SemiVars">semi-continuous</A>, and
<A HREF="#subsubsection:SemiVars">semi-integer</A>.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Continuous Variables</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="subsubsection:ContVars"></A>
<P>
The simplest and least constrained of the available variable types is
the continuous variable.  This variable can take any value between its
lower and upper bound.  In mathematical programming, the convention is
that variables are non-negative unless stated otherwise, so if you
don't explicitly provide bounds for a variable, you should assume that
the lower bound is 0 and the upper bound is infinite.

<P>
The Gurobi APIs provides a symbolic constant to allow you to indicate
that a bound is infinite (<code>GRB_INFINITY</code> in C and C++,
<code>GRB.INFINITY</code> in C#, Java, and Python).  A variable can have an
infinite upper bound, an infinite lower bound (negative infinity), or
both.  A variable with infinite upper and lower bounds is referred to
as a <EM>free variable</EM>.  Any bound larger than 1e30 is treated as
infinite.

<P>
As noted earlier, variables may violate their bounds by tolerances.
In the case of variable bounds, the relevant tolerance value is the
<A HREF="feasibilitytol.html#parameter:FeasibilityTol">FeasibilityTol</A>.  You can
reduce the value of this tolerance parameter, but due to numerical
errors it may not be possible to achieve your desired accuracy.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">General Integer Variables</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="subsubsection:IntVars"></A>
<P>
General integer variables are more constrained than continuous
variables.  In addition to respecting the specified lower and upper
bounds, integer variables also take integral values.

<P>
Due to the limitations of finite-precision arithmetic, integer
variables will often take values that aren't exactly integral.  The
magnitude of the allowed integrality violation is controlled by the
<A HREF="intfeastol.html#parameter:IntFeasTol">IntFeasTol</A> parameter.  You can
tighten this parameter to reduce the magnitude of these integrality
violations, but the cost of solving the optimization problem may
increase significantly as a result.

<P>
The fact that modern computers represent integer values using 32-bit
values places some restrictions on the range of an integral variable.
Specifically, the largest and smallest bounds that can be placed on an
integer variable are +/- 2,000,000,000.  Furthermore, integer
variables with infinite bounds actually have these values as their
implicit bounds.  A solution is not considered feasible unless all
integer variables take values that satisfy these bounds.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Binary Variables</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="subsubsection:BinVars"></A>
<P>
Binary variables are the most constrained variable type that can be
added to your model.  A binary variable takes a value of either 0 or
1.

<P>
Again, due to the limitations of finite-precision arithmetic, binary
variables will often take values that aren't exactly integral.  The
magnitude of the allowed integrality violation is controlled by
the <A HREF="intfeastol.html#parameter:IntFeasTol">IntFeasTol</A> parameter.

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Semi-Continuous and Semi-Integer Variables</SPAN></SPAN>
<A ID="subsubsection:SemiVars"></A>
<P>
You can also add semi-continuous or semi-integer variables to your
model.  A semi-continuous variable has the property that it takes a
value of 0, or a value between the specified lower and upper bounds.
A semi-integer variable adds the additional restriction that the
variable also take an integral value.

<P>
Again, these variables may violate these restrictions up to
tolerances.  In this case, the relevant tolerance is
<A HREF="intfeastol.html#parameter:IntFeasTol">IntFeasTol</A> (even for
semi-continuous variables).
