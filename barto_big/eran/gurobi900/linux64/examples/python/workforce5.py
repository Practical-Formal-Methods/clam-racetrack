# Assign workers to shifts; each worker may or may not be available on a
# particular day. We use multi-objective optimization to solve the model.
# The highest-priority objective minimizes the sum of the slacks
# (i.e., the total number of uncovered shifts). The secondary objective
# minimizes the difference between the maximum and minimum number of
# shifts worked among all workers.  The second optimization is allowed
# to degrade the first objective by up to the smaller value of 10% and 2 */
