' This example formulates and solves the following simple QP model:
'
'   minimize    x + y + x^2 + x*y + y^2 + y*z + z^2
'   subject to  x + 2 y + 3 z >= 4
'               x +   y       >= 1
'               x, y, z non-negative
'
' The example illustrates the use of dense matrices to store A and Q
' (and dense vectors for the other relevant data).  We don't recommend
' that you use dense matrices, but this example may be helpful if you
' already have your data in this format.
