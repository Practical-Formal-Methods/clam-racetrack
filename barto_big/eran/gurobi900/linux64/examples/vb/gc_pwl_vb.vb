' This example formulates and solves the following simple model
' with PWL constraints:
'
'  maximize
'        sum c[j] * x[j]
'  subject to
'        sum A[i,j] * x[j] <= 0,  for i = 0, ..., m-1
'        sum y[j] <= 3
'        y[j] = pwl(x[j]),        for j = 0, ..., n-1
'        x[j] free, y[j] >= 0,    for j = 0, ..., n-1
'  where pwl(x) = 0,     if x  = 0
'               = 1+|x|, if x != 0
'
'  Note
'   1. sum pwl(x[j]) <= b is to bound x vector and also to favor sparse x vector.
'      Here b = 3 means that at most two x[j] can be nonzero and if two, then
'      sum x[j] <= 1
'   2. pwl(x) jumps from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1, if x moves from negatie 0 to 0,
'      then to positive 0, so we need three points at x = 0. x has infinite bounds
'      on both sides, the piece defined with two points (-1, 2) and (0, 1) can
'      extend x to -infinite. Overall we can use five points (-1, 2), (0, 1),
'      (0, 0), (0, 1) and (1, 2) to define y = pwl(x)
