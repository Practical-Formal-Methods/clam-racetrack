' Solve a traveling salesman problem on a randomly generated set of
' points using lazy constraints.   The base MIP model only includes
' 'degree-2' constraints, requiring each node to have exactly
' two incident edges.  Solutions to this model may contain subtours -
' tours that don't visit every node.  The lazy constraint callback
' adds new constraints to cut them off.
