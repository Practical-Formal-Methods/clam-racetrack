' Assign workers to shifts; each worker may or may not be available on a
' particular day. We use Pareto optimization to solve the model:
' first, we minimize the linear sum of the slacks. Then, we constrain
' the sum of the slacks, and we minimize a quadratic objective that
' tries to balance the workload among the workers.
