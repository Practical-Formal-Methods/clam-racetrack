' Sudoku example.
'
' The Sudoku board is a 9x9 grid, which is further divided into a 3x3 grid
' of 3x3 grids.  Each cell in the grid must take a value from 0 to 9.
' No two grid cells in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid may take the
' same value.

' In the MIP formulation, binary variables x(i,j,v) indicate whether
' cell <i,j> takes value 'v'.  The constraints are as follows:
'   1. Each cell must take exactly one value (sum_v x(i,j,v) = 1)
'   2. Each value is used exactly once per row (sum_i x(i,j,v) = 1)
'   3. Each value is used exactly once per column (sum_j x(i,j,v) = 1)
'   4. Each value is used exactly once per 3x3 subgrid (sum_grid x(i,j,v) = 1)
'
' Input datasets for this example can be found in examples/data/sudoku*.
