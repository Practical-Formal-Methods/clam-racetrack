Parameter Tuning Tool
</H1>

<P>
The Gurobi Optimizer provides a wide variety of
<A HREF="parameters.html#sec:Parameters">parameters</A> that allow you to control
the operation of the optimization engines.  The level of control
varies from extremely coarse-grained (e.g., the
<A HREF="method.html#parameter:Method">Method</A> parameter, which allows you to
choose the algorithm used to solve continuous models) to very
fine-grained (e.g., the
<A HREF="markowitztol.html#parameter:MarkowitzTol">MarkowitzTol</A> parameter, which
allows you to adjust the tolerances used during simplex basis
factorization).  While these parameters provide a tremendous amount of
user control, the immense space of possible options can present a
significant challenge when you are searching for parameter settings
that improve performance on a particular model.  The purpose of the
Gurobi tuning tool is to automate this search.

<P>
The Gurobi tuning tool performs multiple solves on your model,
choosing different parameter settings for each solve, in a search for
settings that improve runtime.  The longer you let it run, the more
likely it is to find a significant improvement.  If you are using a
Gurobi Compute Server, you can harness the power of multiple machines
to perform distributed parallel tuning in order to speed up the search
for effective parameter settings.

<P>
The tuning tool can be invoked through two different interfaces.  You
can either use the <code>grbtune</code>
<A HREF="command_line_tuning.html#sec:TuningCommandLine">command-line tool</A>, or you can
invoke it from one of our
<A HREF="tuning_api.html#sec:TuningAPI">programming language APIs</A>.  Both approaches
share the same underlying tuning algorithm, and both allow you to
modify the same set of tuning parameters.

<P>
A number of tuning-related parameters allow you to control the
operation of the tuning tool.  The most important is probably
<A HREF="tunetimelimit.html#parameter:TuneTimeLimit">TuneTimeLimit</A>, which controls
the amount of time spent searching for an improving parameter set.
Other parameters include
<A HREF="tunetrials.html#parameter:TuneTrials">TuneTrials</A> (which attempts to
limit the impact of randomness on the result),
<A HREF="tunecriterion.html#parameter:TuneCriterion">TuneCriterion</A> (which specifies
the tuning criterion),
<A HREF="tuneresults.html#parameter:TuneResults">TuneResults</A> (which controls the
number of results that are returned), and
<A HREF="tuneoutput.html#parameter:TuneOutput">TuneOutput</A> (which controls the
amount of output produced by the tool).

<P>
Before we discuss the actual operation of the tuning tool, let us
first provide a few caveats about the results.  While parameter
settings can have a big performance effect for many models, they
aren't going to solve every performance issue.  One reason is simply
that there are many models for which even the best possible choice of
parameter settings won't produce an acceptable result.  Some models
are simply too large and/or difficult to solve, while others may have
numerical issues that can't be fixed with parameter changes.

<P>
Another limitation of automated tuning is that performance on a model
can experience significant variations due to random effects
(particularly for MIP models).  This is the nature of search.  The
Gurobi algorithms often have to choose from among multiple, equally
appealing alternatives.  Seemingly innocuous changes to the model
(such as changing the order of the constraint or variables), or subtle
changes to the algorithm (such as modifying the random number seed)
can lead to different choices.  Often times, breaking a single tie in
a different way can lead to an entirely different search.  We've seen
cases where subtle changes in the search produce 100X performance
swings.  While the tuning tool tries to limit the impact of these
effects, the final result will typically still be heavily influenced
by such issues.

<P>
The bottom line is that automated performance tuning is meant to give
suggestions for parameters that could produce consistent, reliable
improvements on your models.  It is not meant to be a replacement for
efficient modeling or careful performance testing.
