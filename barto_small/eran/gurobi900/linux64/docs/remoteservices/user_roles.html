User Roles
</H3>

<P>
Users of Gurobi Remote Services will fall into one of three possible
roles:
<A HREF="#sec:ClusterAdminRole">system administrator</A>,
<A HREF="#sec:AdminRole">administrator</A>, or
<A HREF="#sec:ClientRole">standard user</A>.
The system administrator is in charge of setting up the cluster,
adding and removing nodes, etc.  Administrators monitor usage of the
cluster.  They can monitor the length of the server queue, kill jobs,
etc.  Standard users are the programs running on client
machines that ultimately submit jobs or batches to the cluster.

<P>
The Gurobi distribution includes a number of tools that are relevant
to the people in these roles.  These are all covered in much more
detail later on, but we will briefly describe how they fit with the
various roles here.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">System Administrator</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:ClusterAdminRole"></A>
<P>
The system administrator installs and manages a Remote Services
cluster and the different components.  Gurobi Remote Services provides
the following tools to help with this:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="remote_services_agent_grb_.html#sec:RSMNodeAgent">grb_rs</A> is the program that runs on
  the Compute Server and Distributed Worker nodes.  The system
  administrator will need to configure and start it on all of the
  nodes of a Remote Services cluster.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="cluster_manager_server_grb.html#sec:RSMAgent">grb_rsm</A> is the program that runs
  the Cluster Manager.  The system administrator will need to
  configure and start it on one or more machines, as needed. The
  system administrator will also need to set up the Database and
  configure its connection.
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="appendix_e_grbcluster.html#sec:RSClusterRef">grbcluster</A> is used to issue
  commands to an already-running cluster.  Examples of system
  administrator commands include adding or removing nodes, and
  enabling or disabling job processing on a cluster.  This tool
  provides a number of commands; type <TT>grbcluster
    --help</TT> for a full list.
</LI>
<LI>Finally, most of the important responsibilities of the system
  administrator, including user management and cluster health
  monitoring, can also be performed through the Web User Interface of
  the Cluster Manager.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For more details, please refer to the section on
<A HREF="cluster_setup_and_administ.html#sec:RSMClusterSetup">setting up and administering a cluster</A>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Administrator</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:AdminRole"></A>
<P>
An administrator monitors and manages the flow of jobs through a
Remote Services cluster. Examples of administrator commands include
aborting jobs, changing cluster parameters and checking licenses.  The
primary tool for doing so is
<A HREF="appendix_e_grbcluster.html#sec:RSClusterRef">grbcluster</A>.  You can get a full list
of available commands by typing
<TT>grbcluster --help</TT>.
All of these functions are also exposed in the Web User Interface of
the Cluster Manager.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Standard Client</SPAN>
<A ID="sec:ClientRole"></A>
<P>
A Remote Services client submits jobs or batches to the cluster.  This is done
through a user application or through the Gurobi command-line tool
<A HREF="appendix_f_gurobi_cl.html#sec:gurobi_cl">gurobi_cl</A> (which is documented in
the <TT>Gurobi Command-Line Tool</TT> section of the
<A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="../refman/refman.html">Gurobi Reference Manual</A>).
Submitting a job to a Remote Services cluster is typically just a
matter of running the appropriate program.  We will provide a simple
example in the next section.

<P>
Clients can also use the <A HREF="appendix_e_grbcluster.html#sec:RSClusterRef">grbcluster</A>
command to monitor the state of their jobs and of the Remote Services
queue.  Example commands include listing active jobs, listing recently
executed jobs, displaying the log of a recent job, etc.  You can get a
full list of available commands by typing <TT>grbcluster --help</TT>.
<TT>grbcluster</TT> can also be used to submit batches.

<P>
Finally, clients can access the Web User Interface of the Cluster
Manager.  All of the functions provided by <TT>grbcluster</TT> are
available in the web application, including submitting batches using a
drag-and-drop interface.
